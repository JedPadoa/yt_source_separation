Icon requirements for packaging:

For macOS:
- icon.icns (typically 1024x1024 with multiple resolutions)

For Windows:
- icon.ico (typically multiple sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256)

For Linux:
- icon.png (512x512 recommended)

For DMG background (macOS):
- background.png (typically 540x380 but can vary)

You'll need to create these icon files and place them in this directory before packaging.

You can use online conversion tools to create the different icon formats from a PNG image.
